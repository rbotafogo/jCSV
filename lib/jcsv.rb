# Ignoring surrounding spaces if they're not within quotes
# In accordance with RFC 4180, the default behaviour of Super CSV is to treat all spaces
# as important, including spaces surrounding the text in a cell.
#
# This means for reading, a cell with contents    surrounded by spaces    is read with
# surrounding spaces preserved. And for writing, the same String is written with surrounding
# spaces and no surrounding quotes (they're not required, as spaces are considered important).
#
# There are some scenarios where this restriction must be relaxed, in particular when the CSV
# file you're working with assumes that surrounding spaces must be surrounded by quotes,
# otherwise will be ignored. For this reason, Super CSV allows you to enable the
# surrounding_spaces_need_quotes preference.
#
# With surrounding_spaces_need_quotes enabled, it means that for reading, a cell with contents
# '    surrounded by spaces   ' would be read as 'surrounded by spaces' (surrounding spaces
# are trimmed), unless the String has surrounding quotes, e.g. "   surrounded by spaces   ",
# in which case the spaces are preserved. And for writing, any String containing surrounding
# spaces will automatically be given surrounding quotes when written in order to preserve
# the spaces.
#
# You can enable this behaviour by calling surrounding_spaces_need_quotes(true) on the Builder.
# You can do this with your own custom preference, or customize an existing preference

# Skipping comments
# Although comments aren't part of RFC4180, some CSV files use them so it's useful to be able
# to skip these lines (or even skip lines because they contain invalid data). You can use one
# of the predefined comment matchers:
#
# CommentStartsWith - matches lines that start with a specified String
# CommentMatches - matches lines that match a specified regular expression
# Or if you like you can write your own by implementing the CommentMatcher interface.
